# iOS Roadmap (Notes)

This is a scratchpad for near-term iOS ideas. Not committed to any timeline.

## Future Features

- Inbound call UX (PushKit + CallKit) with a real call state machine (deferred; push notifications first).
- E2E encrypted chat sessions (app <-> gateway), to avoid relying on third-party bot channels for private conversations.
- React Server Components + React Native UI materialization:
  Bot outputs server-rendered RSC payloads that hydrate into native UI components in-app (dynamic "micro-apps" inside OpenClaw).
